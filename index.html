        <h2> What is RNA </h2>
        <p>RNA standing for ribonucleic acid is nucleic acid like DNA. However unlike its usually double stranded counterpart, RNA is typically single stranded. RNA is used from many different processes around the cell in both Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes. The function for which RNA performs varies from protein synthesis to gene regulation. Ultimately, its purpose will depend of the specific type of RNA involved.

      <h2>Messenger RNA (mRNA)</h2>
      <article>
        <h3>Structure and General Processing</h3>
        <p>
          A single stranded RNA containing genetic information from the DNA. Messenger RNA is first created in the nucleus through the process of transcription. That information is brought to the cytoplasm where it heads to the ribosomes. mRNA is Made of nucleotide bases:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>adenine(A)</li>
            <li>uracil(U)</li>
            <li>ctyosine(C)</li>
            <li>guanine(G)</li>

        </ul>
        <p>These nucleotide bases are organized in sets of three. There are a total of 61 different codons for amino acids. This is the order for which they are read during the process of translation. </p>

      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>Function</h3>
        <p>
          The main purpose of messenger RNA is for its genetic information to be read in the ribosomes in order to generate polypeptides and proteins for the cell. This happens during the process of translation.  Translation is the process where proteins are created from the information present in messenger RNA's. The mRNA is read by its codons. The majority of the codons exist to characterize a different amino acid. The first codon, known as the start codon, is the characterized by the nucleotide sequence AUG. This is to signal the the start of construction for protein. Also, to signal the end of a polypeptide chain we use the three codons "UAA", "UGA", and "UAG".         </p>

      <h2>Ribosomal RNA (rRNA)</h2>
      <article>
        <h3>Structure and Composition</h3>
        <p>
          Ribosomal RNA is created in the cytoplasm then transferred to the nucleus for subassembly  which happens in the nucleolus. Those subunits are then transferred to the cytoplasm for its final stage of assembly. Ribosomal RNA folds into a rather complex three dimensional structure. Ribosomal RNA along with ribonucleoproteins are the components which make up the organelle known as the ribosome. In eukaryotes the ribosomes are made up of large and small subunits. Known as the 40S and 60S subunits. in Prokaryotes, the large and small subunits are made up of 30S and 50S subunits. Each of the different subunits have their own rRNA types.
        </p>
        <h4>rRNA is Eukaryotes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>18S - in 40S subunits</li>
            <li>28S - in 60S subunits</li>
            <li>5.8S - in 60S subunits</li>
            <li>55S - in 60S subunits</li>

        </ul>

        <h4>rRNA is Prokaryotes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>16S - in 30S subunits</li>
            <li>23S - in 50S subunits</li>
            <li>55S - in 50S subunits</li>

        </ul>

        <h4>Abundance</h4>
        <p>
          It should also be noted that Ribosomal RNA is the most common type of RNA found in eukaryotic cells by far. There can be up to around 5 thousand ribosomal RNA genes in a single cell(3).

      <article>
        <h3>Function</h3>
        <p>
          The main purpose of the ribosomal RNA is to help with the process of translation of the mRNA. In the ribosomes the small subunits read the mRNA while the large join the amino acids to make proteins. THe rRNA also acts catalysis, where it catalyzes the peptide bonds between the amino acids. This is where they perform what is known as the peptidyl transferase activity.

    <section id="trna">
      <h2>Transfer RNA (tRNA)</h2>
      <article>
        <h3>Structure</h3>
        <p>
          The RNA molecules are Typically around 75 to 95 nucleotides long. They are characterized by a set of three nucleotides known as anticodons. Transfer RNA's have a complex three dimensional shape which folds into this L like shape. In two dimensions this is characterized with a clover leaf like structure(1).

      <article>
        <h3>Function</h3>
        <p>
            They aid in the stage of translation in the ribosome. During the process of translation, tRNAs help build proteins by moving through three ribosomal sites—known as the A, P, and E sites—where they deliver amino acids in sequence. Each anticodon pairs with a matching codon on the mRNA strand, ensuring the correct amino acid is brought to the ribosome. There are unique tRNAs for each of the 20 amino acids used in protein production, and often more than one tRNA exists for a single amino acid(4). Depending on the organism, cells typically contain 40 to 60 different types of tRNA, each designed to recognize specific codons and supply the appropriate amino acid during protein assembly.

    <!-- Small Nuclear RNA Section -->
    <section id="snrna">
      <h2>Small Nuclear RNA (snRNA)</h2>
      <article>
        <h3>Structure and Complex Formation</h3>
        <p>
           Small RNAs contain only around 100 to 300 nucleotides. Most of the time they are related to certain  proteins. Those proteins being the ribonucleoproteins. All of this resides in the spliceosome. There are certain key snRNA's: U1, U2, U3, U4, U5, and U6(1).
        </p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>Function</h3>
        <p>
          The main purpose of snRNA is in RNA splicing. This is performed on Pre-mrna so that it can be developed in properly working mrna(5). This process happens during and after transcription. During this process, introns are removed while exons are joined together to form the matured mRNA(5). 
        </p>
        <p>Mutations in the snRNA can lead to many different genetic diseases</p>

    <section id="mirna">
      <h2>MicroRNA (miRNA)</h2>
      <article>
        <h3>Structure and Function</h3>
        <p>
          Short non-coding RNAs, usually between 19 to 25 nucleotides in length(6). Their main purpose is to lower the amount in which a gene is expressed. This is done by altering the amount in which an mRNA is expressed. Small regulatory RNAs such as miRNA are used to alter the lifespan and translation of mRNAs(7). It does this by binding to specific mRNA molecules through a matching process. An RNA protein complex may be made by an miRNA strand binding to a protein. That protein complex may bind to a mRNA to stop it from translation if the miRNA has some mismatch with the mRNA(7). Otherwise, a perfect match may lead to the mRNA being broken down.
